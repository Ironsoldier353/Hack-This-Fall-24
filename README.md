# PredictAura 



**PredictAura** is a suite of health prediction applications designed to provide users with insights into their health. Built using Streamlit, React, and Tailwind CSS, PredictAura offers predictive models for various health conditions, including breast cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and lung cancer. Each model uses machine learning and a set of health parameters provided by the user to make predictions.
